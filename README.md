# vnc-through-ssh

A work in progress....

Goal: make it easier to connect to a particular KVM console 
when the KVM is running on a remote host, especially when the 
host requires multiple hops.  By easier, I mean, easier than setting up port forwarding.

There is some documentation inside the script, but please ask me if you
are wondering if you could benefit from this script.
