# vnc-through-ssh

A work in progress....

Goal: make it easier to connect to a particular KVM console 
when the KVM is running on a remote host, especially when multiple hops are require
to reach the (nested) host.
By easier, I mean, easier than setting up port forwarding, which BTW, does not always work.

There is some documentation inside the script, but please ask me if you
are wondering if you could benefit from this script.
